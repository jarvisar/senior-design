  <h3>Initiating a Search</h3>
  <p>To search NASA's exoplanet database, select a valid query using one of the four available drop-down boxes. 
    Each drop-down box allows for specific information to be entered, such as the hostname of a star, the discovery 
    method used, and the discovery year and facility. To learn more about each option, refer to the input help section. 
    Once a query has been entered, click the search button to retrieve data from NASA's database. Note that the search 
    button will only be enabled once at least one drop-down box has been populated.</p>

  <h3>Understanding the Input</h3>
  <p>When searching, the input options allow for specific information to be entered. Here's what each option means:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The hostname option refers to the name of the star an exoplanet orbits.</li>
    <li>The discovery method option refers to how the exoplanet was first discovered.</li>
    <li>The discovery year option refers to the year the exoplanet was first found.</li>
    <li>The discovery facility option refers to the facility that first discovered the exoplanet.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Receiving Results</h3>
  <p>After submitting a search, the results will be displayed in a table format. 
    Additionally, a download button will appear, allowing the results to be exported to a CSV file on the local disk. 
    To sort the data, click on a column header to toggle between descending and ascending order. 
    By clicking on an individual exoplanet's row, specific data about that exoplanet can be viewed.
  </p>

  <h3>Understanding the Results</h3>
  <p>The results returned from the search will include columns with information such as the exoplanet's hostname, discovery method, discovery year, discovery facility, and academic reference. 
    These pieces of data provide valuable insights into the characteristics and origins of the exoplanets returned in the search.</p>
