    <h3>What is an Exoplanet?</h3>
      <p>An exoplanet, also known as an <a target="_blank" href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/what-is-an-exoplanet/overview/" rel="noreferrer noopener">extrasolar planet</a>, is a planet that orbits a star(s) outside of our solar system. 
      These planets are detected using a variety of methods, such as radial velocity, transit, and direct imaging. 
      <br>
      <br>
      The study of exoplanets is a rapidly growing field in astronomy and has led to the discovery of thousands of planets 
      orbiting stars in our galaxy. The discovery of exoplanets has also led to the possibility of finding potentially 
      habitable planets and the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

  <h3>Initiating a Search</h3>
    <p>To search NASA's exoplanet database, select a valid query using the four available drop-down boxes. 
      Each drop-down box allows for specific information to be entered, such as the hostname of a star, the discovery 
      method used, and the discovery year and facility. To learn more about each option, refer to the input help section. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Once a query has been entered, click the search button to retrieve data from NASA's database. Note that large searches
      can take up to 20 seconds to process. Some example large searches include exoplanets discovered using transit, exoplanets 
      discovered in 2014 and 2016, and exoplanets first observed by Kepler.</p>

    <h3>Understanding the Input</h3>
      <p>When searching, the input options allow for specific information to be entered. Here's what each option represents:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Host name refers to the name of the star an exoplanet orbits.</li>
        <li>Discovery method refers to how the exoplanet was first discovered.</li>
        <li>Discovery year refers to the year the exoplanet was first found.</li>
        <li>Discovery facility refers to the facility that first discovered the exoplanet.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

    <h3>Receiving Results</h3>
      <p>After submitting a search, the results will be displayed in a table format. 
        Additionally, a download button will appear to export the data to the local disk as a CSV file. 
        <br>
        <br>
        To sort the data, click on a column header to toggle between descending and ascending order. 
        By clicking on an individual exoplanet's row, specific data about that exoplanet can be viewed such as its position 
        in the sky and other additional resources. Clicking on a card's title will search for exoplanets with similar data.
      </p>
    <br>
  </mat-card>

    <h3>Understanding the Results</h3>
      <p>The results returned from the search will include columns with information such as the exoplanet's name, host's name, discovery method, discovery year, discovery facility, and academic reference. </p>
        <li>The density column is measured in g/cm<sup>3</sup></li>   
        <li>The radius column is measured in units of radius of the Earth (ER)</li> 
        <li>The mass column is measured in units of mass of the Earth (EM)</li>
        <br>
      <p>For example, an exoplanet with a radius of 0.5 ER has half the radius of the Earth and an exoplanet with 0.5 EM has half the mass of the Earth. For reference, the Earth's radius is 6,371km, its mass is 5.972 x 10<sup>24</sup> kg, and its density is 5.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

  <h4>Data Source</h4>
  <p>This web application utilizes Table Access Protocol <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ivoa.net/documents/TAP/" rel="noreferrer noopener">(TAP)</a> to request and return data from the Exoplanet Archive. 
    TAP is a protocol developed by IVOA that allows access and querying of table data on remote servers, primarily for astronomical data. The list of planets is routinely updated bi-weekly, but may be updated 
    more frequently depending on new significant exoplanet discoveries. </p>
