## Abstract

The main objective of this project is to develop and build a web application capable of querying data from NASA's Exoplanetary Archive using user input. After entering a valid query, the web app will build an API URL using the user's input to call NASA's archive and return the requested data.

After returning the data, the web app will then format the data into a readable form and will give the user the option to export the formatted data to the user's local disk. This web application is built using Angular and utilizes HTTP requests and Table Access Protocol (TAP) to call and return data from the exoplanet archive.
