## Abstract

The main objective of this project is to develop and build a website capable of querying data from NASA's Exoplanetary Archive using user input. After entering a valid query, the website will build an API URL using the user's input to call NASA's archive and return the requested data. 

After returning the data, the website will then format the data into a readable form and will give the user the option to export the formatted data to the user's local disk. We will use Angular TypeScript to build the site and utilize HTTP requests and Table Access Protocol (TAP) to call NASA's Archive.
