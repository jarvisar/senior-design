As a **website user** I want to **search and query NASA's exoplanet database** so that I can **gather the planetary data I need**.

As a **novice astronomer** I want to **learn what each piece of data means/represents** so I can **better understand the data**.

As a **website user**, I want to be able to **filter the data with valid parameters** so I can **better find the data I need**.

As a **researcher** I want to **export the returned data** so that I can **use the returned data on academic projects**.

As a **researcher**, I would like to **see the data source** to ensure the **returned data is accurate and up to date**.
