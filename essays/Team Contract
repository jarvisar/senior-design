#### Our Goal:
Our team’s goal is to create and implement a high-level web application using our knowledge and experience in the computer science field and/or related fields.
#### Our Project:
First and foremost, we want to create a website with a front-end UI using languages such as Angular or ASP.NET. We also want to create a backend database using SQL, and an API using ASP.NET Web APIs with C# if possible. 
#### Team Schedule:
Our team plans to meet at least twice a week to discuss our progress, any issues we might be facing, and/or upcoming assignments. These meetings will take place primarily online in the afternoon using either Microsoft Teams or Zoom, whichever is easiest to use at the time. Since our assignments are generally due Monday nights, we would like to meet sometime over the weekend (Friday through Sunday) to discuss the upcoming assignment(s) due. 
#### Team Roles:
Since our team consists of two computer science majors, we will both be assuming the role of programmer for this project. In addition to this, we plan to assign one of us to focus on the front-end, while the other focuses on the backend. 
#### Collaboration:
Our main form of collaboration will be within our GitHub repository and our OneDrive folder. All our code and/or project data will be stored in our GitHub repository, while our OneDrive folder will be used primarily for internal communication and file sharing (such as in-progress assignments). We will also utilize Microsoft Teams and Outlook email to collaborate and communicate.
