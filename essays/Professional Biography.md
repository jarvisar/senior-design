### Project Sought

I am very open-minded in terms of a project. 

While I'm not sure what specific topic I'd like to research for the capstone, I am very open to hearing new ideas and working with new technologies/languages. Right now I'm focused on a software-based project, but I am always willing to research and consider new topics.
