## Milestones

#### 1. Research available technologies / languages
Our first major milestone is deciding on what programming languages or technologies we primarily use to develop our software. As of right now, we are focusing on either ASP.net or Angular, leaning towards Angular. 

#### 2. Create front-end UI with required fields / textboxes / UI elements
Using our front-end language from the first milestone, create the necessary fields and begin to build the platform/website. 

#### 3. Push code to GitHub and start creating final website
At this milestone, we want to push our code to GitHub and possible create a website using GitHub pages. While all the buttons and UI might not be functional, our website runs and is accessible by others.

#### 4. Start to add functionality to UI elements
Start to add back-end logic for all the front-end UI elements. Start building the API URL using the query input by the user. 

#### 5. Implement API calling and return formatted NASA data
The back-end logic should be complete and we can start to call NASA's database using the data from milestone 4. We also want to format this data so we can display it to the user

#### 6. Bonus Features
At this point, our program / website should be fully functional and we can start to implement bonus features such as data export, fun graphics/illustrations, and other features.
