## Project Constraints

#### Economic
Economic cost is an important constraint to consider, since our budget is relatively low. However, most of the technologies and languages we will use are free to use and won't cost any money. Some of the tools we plan on using for debugging and testing such as Postman charge for the premium version, but fortunately they provide a student version with the same capabilities for free.

#### Ethical 
Given that our website will primarily return data from NASA's Exoplanetary archive, we want to ensure that the data we return is accurate and correct. We want all our users to trust our website and be able to understand the data. To do this, we will ensure that the data returned accurately reflects the data in NASA's Archive and we plan on explaining what some of the data means or represents.

#### Time
One of the biggest constraints for this project is time. While we have a good understanding of our project and what needs to be done, we still need to research and start to learn some of the languages and software we need to use. Given that our project's prototype should be completed after this semester and the project should be completely finished by the spring, time is our biggest constraint. 

#### Technical Knowledge
Even though we feel that we are capable of developing and maintaining our website, some of the smaller features might be difficult to implement. While we have experience in front-end and back-end development, neither of us have much experience in creating a website from scratch and we will likely need to spend time researching how to do certain things. 

#### Scope
The scope of our project is also a major constraint. In the planning stage, we kept having great ideas that we thought would be cool to implement. However, once we started recording our development plan and major milestones, we started to realize that the scope of our project might be limited due to our technical knowledge and time available (as seen above).
